# Publication plan (draft)

This is a planning note (not a claim).

## Target venues (examples)

- PL / language implementation workshops (fast feedback on methodology and artifact packaging)
- Artifact-evaluation-focused tracks (where evidence packaging is central)
- Systems-oriented venues if the evaluation pipeline is positioned as an engineering contribution

## Why these venues

- The primary contribution is methodological (artifact packaging + reproducible equivalence evaluation).
- The artifact provides committee-friendly evidence mapping and integrity metadata.

## Submission artifacts

- Draft manuscript: paper.md
- Technical report (committee-facing): docs/TECHREPORT.md
- One-page summary: docs/COMMITTEE_ONEPAGER.md
- Evidence index: results/README.md
- Citations: citations.bib and CITATION.cff
