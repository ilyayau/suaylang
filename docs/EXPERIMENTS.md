# Experimental Protocol

All experiments are deterministic (fixed seeds, commit hash, environment recorded).

- One-command reproduction: `make reproduce`
- Output artifacts: results/*.md, results/*.json, see [docs/TECH_REPORT.md](../docs/TECH_REPORT.md) (PDF: run `make tech-report-pdf`)
- Reviewer path: see README for summary, see results/ for metrics, see paper/ for canonical report.
