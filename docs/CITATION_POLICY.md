# Citation policy

## Authoritative citation

- Use CITATION.cff as the authoritative source of repository citation metadata.

## BibTeX

- Use docs/citations.bib for BibTeX entries referenced by docs/TECHREPORT.md and related work.
- docs/refs.bib is a citation-ready bibliography for paper-like writing.

## No invented publications

- This repository does not claim a published SuayLang paper unless an external preprint/venue link is added.
- Numeric results are not asserted in narrative docs; they are read from artifacts under results/.
