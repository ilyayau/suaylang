# Reproducibility badges plan

This document describes a practical badge plan (not guaranteed).

- Primary: ACM/SIGPLAN-style artifact availability + functional reproducibility.
- Evidence: CI logs + published results artifacts + hashes.
- Stretch: independent reproduction receipt under results/independent_reproduction/.

Inputs:

- docs/ACM_REPRODUCIBILITY_CHECKLIST.md
- docs/ARTIFACT_EVALUATION.md
- results/manifest.json and results/hashes.txt
