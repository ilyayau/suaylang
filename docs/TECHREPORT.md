# Technical Report (TECHREPORT)

This document is the committee-facing, paper-like report.

It is written to avoid “narrative-only” claims: concrete values must be read from evidence artifacts generated by the protocol.

## Abstract

SuayLang is a research language designed to study observational equivalence between two independent executions: a reference interpreter and a bytecode VM. The artifact packages a protocol, an explicit observation policy, and integrity metadata (hashes) so a committee reviewer can audit and reproduce evidence without relying on GitHub rendering features.

## Research question

Can two independent executions (interpreter and VM) be made observationally equivalent under an explicit observation policy, and can this equivalence be evaluated as a reproducible research artifact?

## Method (what is computed)

1) Run a baseline suite where each Suay program is executed in both backends.
2) Record observable outputs (value/error/stdout) under the observation policy.
3) Emit evidence artifacts (tables + JSON) and compute hashes.

Protocol:

```sh
make reproduce-all
```

Observation policy:

- docs/OBSERVATION_POLICY.md

## Results (where to read them)

Numeric results are not asserted in this report; they are read from artifacts:

- Artifact index: results/README.md
- Baseline timings: results/baseline.md
- Integrity metadata: results/manifest.json and results/hashes.txt
- Microbench example + derived plot: benchmarks/results.md and docs/plots/microbench_relative.png

## Discussion

This artifact emphasizes a committee-auditable research style:

- explicit observation policy,
- claim→artifact→command mapping, and
- integrity metadata (hashes) for generated evidence.
