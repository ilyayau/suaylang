# Research timeline (6–12 months)

This is a planning document (not a claim).

## Milestones (versioned)

- M0 (Week 1–2): CI green + 30s/7m/15m reviewer paths stable.
- M1 (Month 1–2): Spec bundle frozen for v0.1; spec–implementation diff log started.
- M2 (Month 2–4): Differential testing scaled; regression corpus accumulated; coverage reporting.
- M3 (Month 4–6): Performance protocol upgraded (multi-run stats, CI perf budget).
- M4 (Month 6–9): Paper submission candidate; external reproduction receipt.
- M5 (Month 9–12): Release v0.1 + archived artifacts (+ optional DOI).

## Expected outputs

- 1 paper (workshop or venue fit per docs/PUBLICATION_PLAN.md)
- 1 demo (one-command reproduction)
- 1 maintained tool (SuayLang interpreter + VM + evaluation pipeline)
