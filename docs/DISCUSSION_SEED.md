# Discussion Seed: Reviewer/Community Prompts

To encourage constructive review and future research, we propose the following discussion seeds:

1. **What is the minimal set of diagnostics required for a language to be considered robust?**
2. **How should equivalence be defined for programs with observable nondeterminism?**
3. **What are the trade-offs between mechanized and human-proxy evaluation for new languages?**
4. **How can the artifact better support incremental adoption in existing codebases?**
5. **What is the best way to balance formal rigor and practical usability in language design?**

**Reviewers are invited to:**
- Suggest additional falsification scenarios.
- Propose alternative baseline oracles.
- Identify any hidden assumptions in the diagnostics contract.
