# Conformance (interpreter ↔ VM)

This document is the canonical conformance definition for research evaluation.

For the full definition, scope statement, and how-to-run instructions, see:
- docs/research/CONFORMANCE.md

Rationale for duplication:
- Some reviewer paths and external links are case-sensitive and expect a lowercase filename.
