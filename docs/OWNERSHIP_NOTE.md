# Ownership note

This repository is maintained as a research artifact.

## Maintainer intent

- The maintainer is responsible for keeping CI green and preserving a reviewer-friendly, reproducible evaluation pipeline.
- The repository treats reproducibility and auditability as first-class requirements.

## Commit author name mismatches

Some commits may show a different local author name than the maintainer’s current preferred display name. This can happen due to:

- multi-device development,
- different local git configs,
- institutional accounts.

To set your local identity:

```sh
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "you@example.com"
```
