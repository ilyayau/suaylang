# MEXT trajectory (SuayLang)

This document outlines the planned research trajectory for SuayLang in the context of Japan/MEXT research goals.

## Year 1 (2025–2026)
- Extend evaluation: more seeds, larger program corpus, deeper coverage.
- Add baseline comparisons (e.g., naive interpreter, raw diagnostics).
- Harden observation policy and diagnostics contract.
- Grow golden diagnostics and regression corpus.
- Target: internal technical report, student workshop submission.

## Year 2 (2026–2027)
- Formalize semantics and observation policy.
- Expand to broader language features (as evidence allows).
- Prepare publishable technical report and artifact bundle.
- Target: lab seminar, national student workshop, technical report.

## Subfield mapping
- Programming languages (semantics, interpreter/VM validation)
- Testing and verification (differential testing, diagnostics)
- Tooling (artifact reproducibility, reviewer evidence)

## Target venues (tentative)
- SIGPL (Japan) student workshop
- JSSST (Japan Society for Software Science and Technology) technical report
- Lab seminar (internal/external)

## Submission-ready artifact checklist
- [ ] PDF: research plan, claim, protocol
- [ ] Results bundle: diff_report, coverage, benchmarks, baseline, golden diagnostics
- [ ] Scripts: make research, runners, environment metadata
- [ ] README: committee TL;DR, results table, reviewer path
- [ ] All claims linked to artifacts
