# Ethics statement

This artifact evaluates language runtime equivalence and reproducibility tooling.

- No human subjects data is collected.
- No personally identifiable information (PII) is processed by the evaluation pipeline.
- Benchmarks and corpora are repository-local source files; provenance is documented.

If the artifact is extended to use external datasets or user traces, an updated ethics and privacy statement should be added.
