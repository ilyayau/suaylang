# Evaluation

## Metrics
- Differential test: number of programs, seed range, divergences count, divergence classes.
- Coverage breakdown: language constructs (not code coverage).
- Diagnostic quality: span precision rate, stability rate, minimality proxy.
- Mutation catch rate: number of injected faults caught.
- Worst-case stress: deep nesting, long expressions, pathological inputs.

## Determinism Controls
- Fixed seeds list
- N repetitions per test
- Timeouts for stress tests
- Noise handling: median runtime, deterministic diagnostics
