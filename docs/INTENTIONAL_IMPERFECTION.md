# Intentional Imperfection: Discussion Seed

This artifact intentionally leaves the following open or imperfect, to seed discussion and future work:

1. **Error Message Granularity**
   - Not all diagnostics are maximally user-friendly; some are minimal for contract coverage.
2. **Module System**
   - Only core module semantics are implemented; advanced features (e.g., cyclic imports) are deferred.
3. **Performance Baselines**
   - Microbenchmarks are included, but not all optimization avenues are explored.
4. **Human Study**
   - Human-proxy metrics are provided, but no full user study is included.
5. **Formalization**
   - The formal core is specified, but not all edge cases are mechanized.

**Purpose:**
- To make boundaries explicit, invite critique, and clarify what is not claimed.
