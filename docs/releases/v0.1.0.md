# SuayLang v0.1.0 — Release Notes

Release date: 2025-12-15  
Tag: `v0.1.0`  
Package: `suaylang==0.1.0`

## Scope (what this release is)

SuayLang v0.1.0 is a research-oriented, reviewer-facing MVP of an opinionated, expression-oriented language.
The focus is *explicit control flow* (`dispatch`, `cycle`), a reference interpreter, and a second execution path (bytecode compiler + VM) for comparison and engineering exploration.

This release also establishes a strict UX contract: user-facing CLI failures must not leak Python tracebacks.

## Stability & compatibility policy

This project follows Semantic Versioning with the following clarifications for `0.x`:

- Patch releases (`0.1.x`) must preserve source compatibility with the v0.1 grammar and preserve behavior for valid programs, except for explicitly unspecified formatting details.
- Minor releases (`0.2`, `0.3`, …) may introduce breaking changes, but must include clear migration notes.

The authoritative definition of “SuayLang v0.1” is:
- Language contract: [docs/LANGUAGE_CONTRACT_v0.1.md](../LANGUAGE_CONTRACT_v0.1.md)
- Grammar reference: [docs/GRAMMAR.md](../GRAMMAR.md)

## Highlights

### Language surface (v0.1)
- Explicit branching as an expression: `dispatch` (`▷ … ⇒ …`)
- Explicit looping as a state machine: `cycle` (`⟲ … ↩ … / ↯ …`)
- Expression-oriented scoping: `⟪ … ⟫` blocks, lexical closures, curried application (`·`)
- Data modeling primitives: lists, tuples, maps, and algebraic variants (`Tag•payload`)

### Implementations
- Interpreter as the reference behavior.
- Bytecode compiler + stack VM for a supported subset.
  - The bytecode format and instruction set are *implementation details* and may change in `0.1.x`.

### Tooling
- CLI entrypoint (`suay`) with `run`, `check`, `ast`, and `doctor`.
- VS Code extension (syntax highlighting + minimal LSP).

### Testing & correctness signals
- Unit + integration tests.
- Stress tests enforce the “no Python tracebacks” requirement.

## Known limitations (explicitly not in v0.1)

The v0.1 contract explicitly does not include:
- A syntax-level module system (`import`/`export`).
- Static typing or type checking.
- User-level exception handling.

Module loading exists only as an MVP builtin: `link · path · name → value`.

## Installation & quick verification

From a source checkout:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"  # if you want linters/tests
python -m pip install -e .

suay doctor
suay run examples/hello.suay
pytest -q
python scripts/smoke.py
```

## Artifacts

Release artifacts are expected to include:
- `dist/suaylang-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`
- `dist/suaylang-0.1.0.tar.gz`
