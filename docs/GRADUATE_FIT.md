# Graduate Fit: SuayLang as a Thesis

## How this becomes a thesis
- SuayLang is designed as a research artifact, not a product.
- All claims are falsifiable and backed by saved artifacts.
- The protocol, metrics, and results are suitable for a technical report or thesis.

## Subfields
- Programming languages (semantics, interpreter/VM validation)
- Program testing/verification (differential testing, diagnostics)
- Language tooling (artifact reproducibility, reviewer evidence)

## Plausible outputs
- Technical report (SIGPL, JSSST, or similar)
- Student workshop submission
- Lab seminar presentation
