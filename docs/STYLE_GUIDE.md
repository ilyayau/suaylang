# Documentation Style Guide

- Use precise, academic language. No marketing.
- MUST/SHOULD/MAY for requirements.
- All claims must link to evidence.
- No placeholders or TODOs.
- Use consistent terminology: Interpreter, VM, Baseline, Equivalence, Divergence, Coverage.
- Keep README short, move depth to docs/.
