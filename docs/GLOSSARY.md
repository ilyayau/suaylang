# Glossary

- **Observation policy**: normative definition of what outputs are compared (value/error/stdout) and what is excluded.
- **Backend**: one execution engine (interpreter or VM).
- **Interpreter**: reference evaluator for SuayLang AST.
- **Bytecode VM**: stack-based virtual machine executing compiled instructions.
- **Observational equivalence**: two backends produce the same observation under the policy.
- **Artifact-driven evidence**: results are read from files under results/ rather than narrative claims.
- **Counterexample**: a program showing a divergence (used to falsify the hypothesis).
