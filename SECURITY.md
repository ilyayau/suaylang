## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you found a security issue:

1) Please **do not** open a public issue with exploit details.
2) If the repository has GitHub Security Advisories enabled, use that channel.
3) Otherwise, open a minimal issue titled "Security contact requested" without details.
   A maintainer will respond with a private contact method.

What to include (privately):

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment (what an attacker can do)
- Any suggested fix, if you have one

## Disclosure timeline

- Acknowledgement: best effort within 7 days
- Fix or mitigation: best effort within 30 days

This is a small research/engineering project; timelines are best-effort, but reports are taken seriously.
