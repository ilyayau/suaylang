# Results Folder Guide

This folder contains all experiment outputs, metrics, and evidence artifacts for SuayLang artifact evaluation.

## Structure

## How to read

## Reproduce
Run `make reproduce-all` from repo root. All outputs will be regenerated and checksummed.

# Results Folder Guide & Artifact Index

This folder contains all experiment outputs, metrics, and evidence artifacts for SuayLang artifact evaluation. Every file is directly referenced from the main claim, and all results are reproducible by running the pipeline.

# Results: Artifact Index

This directory is the committee-facing index of **evidence artifacts**.

All files here are (a) generated by a documented command and (b) referenced by claim-level docs.

## Canonical reproduction

From repo root:

```sh
make reproduce-all
```

If results diverge (or artifacts are missing), follow: docs/REPRODUCIBILITY.md

## Artifact index

| Artifact | File(s) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline suite | baseline.md, baseline_raw.json | paired-program timings (per machine) |
| Plots | img/performance.png, img/coverage.png | figures derived from baseline_raw.json |
| Integrity | manifest.json, hashes.txt | per-artifact SHA-256 hashes + environment metadata |

Note: additional artifacts may exist depending on which pipeline profile you run.

## How to use this folder as evidence

- Start with `manifest.json` and `hashes.txt` to confirm you’re reading artifacts for the current commit.
- Read the claim↔evidence mapping: docs/CLAIM_EVIDENCE_MATRIX.md
- Use docs/REVIEWER_PORTAL.md as the high-level navigation hub.
- **ablation.md**: Ablation study table
