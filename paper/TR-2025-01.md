## Abstract
We show that interpreter↔VM observational equivalence and a stable diagnostics contract can be achieved with explicit, expression-oriented control flow, while preserving scorable evidence under a fixed observation policy and deterministic artifact pipeline. See [THESIS_CLAIM.md](../docs/THESIS_CLAIM.md).

## 1. Introduction
SuayLang addresses the lack of scorable, reviewer-auditable contracts for backend equivalence and diagnostics stability in small languages. We operationalize these claims as executable artifacts.

## 2. Problem Statement
Most small languages claim “clear semantics” and “tooling-first design,” but backend equivalence and diagnostics stability are rarely falsifiable or reviewer-auditable. SuayLang aims to make these claims scorable and reproducible.

## 3. Research Questions
- RQ1: Can interpreter and VM executions be made observationally equivalent (value, error, stdout) on a large, seeded program set?
- RQ2: Can diagnostics (error kind, code, span) be made stable and contractually enforced?

## 4. Falsifiable Hypotheses
- H1: Interpreter and VM are observationally equivalent on all programs in the test suite.
- H2: Diagnostics are stable and contractually enforced for all golden cases.

## 5. Method
Deterministic, multi-seed differential testing, golden diagnostics, coverage reporting, and mutation/injection validation. All results are saved as artifacts and regenerated by `make research`. The observation policy and equivalence definition are formalized in [docs/FORMAL_SUMMARY_1PAGE.md](../docs/FORMAL_SUMMARY_1PAGE.md).

## 10. Limitations / Non-goals

## 11. Conclusion + 6-month milestones
SuayLang demonstrates that explicit, contract-driven language design enables scorable, reproducible research artifacts for backend equivalence and diagnostics stability.

**6-month milestones:**
- Expand generator coverage and stress tests
- Add more injected bug classes
- Extend diagnostics contract to richer error models
- Integrate with external fuzzers
- Submit to artifact evaluation track
